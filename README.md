# Client Scheduling Data Analysis

The problem defines multiple clients with different priority to be scheduled with a certain number of available quarterly resources.<br>

I analysed the test data and came up with 2 strategies to solve the problem and keep all the clients happy - <br>
<br>
Strategy 1 - Higher priority client first - Higher priority client gets all resources.<br>
Strategy 2 - As we can imagine Strategy 1 has many issues, so strategy 2 is division of resources based on priority. (Higher priority client get bigger chunk of resources.)
